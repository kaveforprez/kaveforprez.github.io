## What is Kaveforprez?

When I was in 8th grade I pitched a project to my history teacher: I would build a website to showcase the political platform of my mock-presidential candidacy. I was inspired to call the website "Kaveforprez" and I signed up for a corresponding Angelfire website account. I never did make the platform, but I spent a lot of time learning HTML, which served me in a different way in life.

Having satisfied myself with the ability to make a bunch of high-contrast tables, I was left with the regret of never finishing the political aspect of the project. Years and years passed, during which I did build a platform and continuously update it - but this was always a mental exercise.

No matter how many years past, I still amused myself with the idea of actually making the site, so finally, here it is. The domain name and the web stack have improved significantly, but the concept remains the same.
